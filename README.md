# Backup-Photoshop-Settings-Universal
A simple script to facilitate backing-up common Photoshop settings before updating or migrating. This cross-platform script simply opens three common directories where Photoshop assets are stored, the rest is up to the end user to manually backup:

Mac OS Example:
* /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop 2021
* /Users/username/Library/Preferences/Adobe Photoshop 2021 Settings
* /Applications/Adobe Photoshop 2021/Presets
 
Win OS Example:
* C:\Users\username\appData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2021\Presets
* C:\Users\username\appData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2021\Adobe Photoshop 2021 Settings
* C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2021\Presets
